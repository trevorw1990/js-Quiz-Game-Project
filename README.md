JS Game (Quiz)

This project focuses on algorithms and basic data structure concepts. It contains iterations and functions from research done via resources from my school and online articles. The array and structure concepts are used to implement the project. This quiz generally works on the data stored in the code. Code: JavaScript, HTML programming languages, styled using CSS.

Goal:
The main goal of creating this project is that this kind of system can be used in to make fun game quizzes for younger adults once it is perfected. This project is designed in Java Script and HTML, and styled using CSS. As a part of the project different variables, functions and strings have been used. It will be very convenient and easy for the users to operate and understand. 

Objective:
The objective of this questionnaire game is to facilitate user friendly environment for all the players. In the past days quiz used to be conducted manually but in further resolution we are able to generate score.

Introduction:
The project is implemented using JavaScript and HTML as programming language, and is styled using CSS. The data structure used is ‘array’. Various functions are performed on this 2D array. Each array element contains a question, 4 options, and the correct answer. I’ve stored a total of 10 questions in the code and set the max no. of questions to be asked in the quiz as 5. This can be changed according to the needs of the body organizing the quiz. 1.Each question is compulsory
 
1. Every question has 4 options, out of which only 1 is correct 
2. For every correct answer, 10 points are awarded 
3. 50 is a winning score. Anything less results in a losing score. 
4. Once answered, it can not be modified and the next question will be displayed immediately 
5. A correct answer is green, while an incorrect answer is red. 
6. A progress bar is displayed on the top left, which indicates the number of questions answered 
7. The score obtained is displayed on the top right, which indicates the score obtained till the point 
8. Once all the questions are answered, the final score is displayed 



Improvements needed:

* Adding multiple choice questions.
* Storing data in more organized way in database.
* A tab for viewing high scores can be introduced.
* User feedback option can be introduced.
